              <span>A BRIEF INTRODUCTION</span>
              Fit Finder is a mobile application design built with active people in mind. The concept is based off of Meet Up but implemented to focus specifically on fitness groups.The design is simple and modern with a cool color palette. It is easy to navigate and accessible.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              The idea is that this is a social media application that brings people in your community together to workout. Think of this as a way to meet new friends, get involved in your community, and meet wellness-minded people, all while getting in a great workout.
            </p>
            <p>
              The inspiration for building a meet up fitness app was actually inspired by my moving to a new city and wanting to meet new people who enjoyed being active and living a healthy lifestyle. I found that Meet Up was too broad and overloaded to find what I was looking for and there were no other apps out there that really implemented this idea. Thus, Fit Finder was born.
            </p>

          <span>THE BEGINNING</span>
          The decision to go mobile came later in the progress. I will go into more detail about this decision below in my Challenge and Solution sections. I wanted my app to be more of a social media connection outlet so I decided that mobile would be the best way to implement this. To begin, I started with the first screen that a user would connect with, a simple Log In screen. The screen shown above is the first frame that I built out for my app which set the tone for the rest of the application.

        <p>
          <span>A LOOK</span>
          One of my favorite parts about the Meet Up app is it's calendar. I decided to use this as the basis for building a calendar in the Fit Finder application. This is the first page the user will view after they log in. As you can see, I created a basic navigation view that sicks to the bottom of each view, allowing for for easy flow from page to page. The main pages of importantace are profile, calendar, groups, and messages. The calendar show you the upcoming events in your selected groups which links to an event page with one touch. You can also view Calendar in monthly mode.

        <p>
          <span>GROUPS</span>
          Finding fitness groups is based off of user location and fitness interests. This application will ultimately use Google Maps API to input location. You have the option to choose how close to your current area that you would like to search for groups in (within 5 miles, 10 miles, etc.). There is a long list of sample categories for you to choose from ranging from yoga, to hiking, to nutrition. These categories will take you to a group page specific to the category selected and your current location. You also have the option to search for specific groups by manually typing it into a search bar. Finding groups is designed to be minimalistic and easy to navigate.

        <p>
          <span>PROFILE</span>
          The profile design for Fit Finder is simple. Users have the option to download one profile image, add and take away their fitness interests, and log out of the app. The profile will display what groups they are members of and what city they are in. I modeled my profile off of applications such as Quora and Meet Up where the profile page is brief and to the point. This profile is your identity within the app and will link you to your added groups and events message conversations within the application. I choose to make the profile very basic as to not take away from the purpose of the application itself, which is to meet up with members at fitness events and in person instead of just communicating via mobile.

            <span>CHALLENGE~CONTEXT</span>
              Lifestyle applications that focus on heathy living and wellness are becoming increasingly popular in this day and age. As is the demand for mobile social apps that link us with the community around us. The goal of Fit Finder was to bring these two ideas together to create a fitness application that focuses on bringing people together to work out.
          </p>
          <p>
            The biggest challenge to building Fit Finder was a very tight time constraint of only about a week to complete the entire prototype. Due to the excessive amount of pages that must be designed due to the nature of the application, there are certain aspects of the app that are still in production. Another challenge was the decision to change from desktop to mobile. The entire application was redesigned to better fit the needs of the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ultimate goal of Fit Finder is to bring fit minded people together.

          <p>
            <span>SOLUTION</span>
                The key part of Fit Finder's identity system is a fluid, symplistic design that communicates the magic behind its intention. Fit Finder is easy to navigate and allows for a medium that achieves it's goal of bringing together the community in health and fun. Thus far, the response to Fit Finder has been incredibly positive.
